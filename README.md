# 5ive Ingredient :: CLI

**What does your program do? What do you need to know to install it? How do you run it? What websites / APIs does it use?**

Due to the current circumstances people are cooking at home more than they used to be, some for the first time. If you’re a beginner, strapped for time or resource starved. Staring at a list of ingredients a mile long can be overwhelming and the makings of a daunting task to make a meal for yourself or others. Utilizing an API, a user can search for recipes, recipes that only contain five ingredients.  Which means simpler and easier to cook recipes.

**Note: This is a CLI application**

It utilizes the API from [www.edamam.com](https://www.edamam.com/)

**For this CLI to function you must obtain a key from:** [developer.edamam.com](https://developer.edamam.com/)

`APP_ID` & `API_KEY` will need to modified in `lib/services/APIservice.rb` with your Id & Key

# 5ive Ingredient Recipes

Due to the current circumstances people are cooking at home more than they used to be, some for the first time. If you’re a beginner, strapped for time or resource starved. Staring at a list of ingredients a mile long can be overwhelming and a daunting task to make a meal for yourself or others. Utilizing an API, a user can search for simpler recipes, recipes that only contain five ingredients.   Which means simpler and easier to cook recipes, which are often overlooked by food blogs because they are deemed too simple to publish.

**Note: This is a CLI application**

You will be initially asked to choose from a list of 5 proteins. Once you have made your selection you will be presented a list of 15 different recipes. Enter the number of it and you will find out more information, the ingredients and a url link to the step by step instructions.

**For this CLI to function you must obtain a key from:** [developer.edamam.com](https://developer.edamam.com/)

`APP_ID` `API_KEY` will need to modified in APIservice.rb with your Id & Key

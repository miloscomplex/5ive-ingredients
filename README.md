# 5ive Ingredients :: CLI

Due to the current circumstances, people cook at home more than they used to be, some for the first time. Suppose youâ€™re a beginner, strapped for time, or resource-starved. Staring at a list of ingredients a mile long can be overwhelming and the makings of a daunting task to make a meal for yourself or others. Utilizing an API, a user can search for recipes, recipes that only contain five ingredients, which means more straightforward and easier to cook recipes.

**Note: This is a CLI application**

It utilizes the API from [www.edamam.com](https://www.edamam.com/)

**For this CLI to function you must obtain a key from:** [developer.edamam.com](https://developer.edamam.com/)
